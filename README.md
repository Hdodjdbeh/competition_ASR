# competition_ASR
## In this task I solved the problem of speech-to-text translation. I used whisper-tiny as a baseline. To achieve better quality I decided to increase the "chaos" of the model's responses and then rank them using the Russian version of Bert. Some post-processing of the data was also used. I managed to achieve a quality of WER = 0.14
